## 🧭 Overview

This Docker Desktop Extension creates a temporary proxy container using [noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC), giving you browser-based access to any VNC server — whether it's inside another container or running on a remote host.

### 🔑 Key Features

- Connect to Docker containers, images, or remote VNC servers
- Automatic Docker networking and cleanup
- Secure session management with persistent storage
- Includes pre-built environments:
    - [Xfce](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/xfce)
    - [Cinnamon](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/cinnamon)
    - [MATE](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/mate)
    - [KDE-Plasma](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/kde-plasma)
    - [LXDE](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/lxde)
    - [LXQT](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/lxqt)
    - [xTerm](/docker/vnc_ubuntu/xterm)

## 🚀 What You Can Do

### 🖥️ Run GUI-Based Linux Applications

Launch popular apps without installing anything on your host:

- Browsers (Firefox, Chromium)
- Editors (VS Code, LibreOffice)
- Tools (GIMP, PDF viewers)

And many more...

    ✔️ Ideal for isolated, disposable environments. Ideal for temporary, sandboxed tasks without cluttering your OS.

### 🌐 Web Dev & Browser Testing

Spin up clean browser instances in seconds for testing login flows, UI layouts, or performance.

    💡 Use multiple containers for parallel testing.

### 🤖 Selenium Testing

Try our ready-to-use Selenium testing example:

1. Navigate to the [/examples/selenium](/examples/selenium) directory
2. Follow the step-by-step guide in the README file to:
    - Set up a Selenium Chrome container
    - Run automated browser tests
    - Watch the tests execute in real-time


    🔍 Perfect for visual debugging of Selenium test suites

### 🔬 Malware or File Analysis (Safely)

Open suspicious files in an isolated Linux environment.

    🔒 Just close the container to dispose of everything.

### 🛠️ GUI Debugging in Containers

Run GUI debuggers or desktop editors inside a container.

    💻 Perfect for debugging GUI-based apps or editors (e.g. GDB GUI, VS Code Desktop) without leaving Docker.

### 📦 Legacy Software in CI/CD

Use GUI-reliant tools in headless pipelines.

    🔁 Ideal for automated PDF/image generation or GUI testing.

### 🎓 Disposable Desktops for Training

Provide ready-to-use Linux desktops for workshops, demos, or internal labs.

    🎓 Great for teaching Linux, Docker, or OSS tools.

### 🎤 Audio Support (Input & Output)

The extension fully supports real-time, low-latency audio using FFmpeg and PulseAudio under the hood. You can route complete audio output (listening to apps) or audio input (using your browser mic) seamlessly.

| **Component**                 | **Role**  | **Resilience Strategy**                                              |
|-------------------------------| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FFmpeg**                    | Source    | Runs in an **immortal background loop** inside the target container. |
| **MediaMTX**                  | Proxy     | Acts as an **SRT Caller**, proactively reaching out to FFmpeg.       |
| **Electron / Docker Desktop** | Client    | Uses **Exponential Backoff** to wait for the stream to be ready.     |
| **Networking**                | Transport | Forced **ICE-over-TCP** to ensure stability over Docker's bridge.    |

> 📚 **Check out the [Audio Setup Guide](./docs/audio/README.md)** to learn how to explicitly configure Audio Support on your own custom Docker Images.
